                    My name is <strong>Handel de la Paz Batista</strong>. I consider myself a simple person who always seeks to enjoy life to the fullest. 
                    I treat others as I would like to be treated, and I value relationships based on respect and trust.
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, I love playing video games in my free time, especially Call of Duty or baseball games. 
                    Although lately I've been getting hooked on pool games. I also enjoy playing volleyball. 
                    I have a calm personality and I tend to be reserved, especially with people I don't know. 
                    However, I'm always willing to help in whatever way I can.
                    <br>
                    Currently, I'm studying Computer Science, and my main goal is to complete my university 
                    degree and find a job that allows me to be independent. Although I don't have any notable 
                    academic or professional achievements at the moment, I have begun to explore the world of 
                    cybersecurity, a field that I find fascinating and full of possibilities. I'm convinced that, 
                    if I continue on this path, I'll be able to build a promising future.
                    <br>
                    I created this website as part of a final project for my class. Through it, I hope to share a 
                    little of myself, make my work known, and, perhaps, leave a positive impression on my classmates 
                    and professor. Furthermore, I believe that developing these skills will help me communicate 
                    effectively with colleagues, superiors, and clients in my future professional career.
